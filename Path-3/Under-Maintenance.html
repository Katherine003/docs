    <br><br><br> A little ways into the dark you stumble upon a group of tiny people in hard hats with startlingly bright <br>
    construction lights attempting to patch a large hole in the path.<br>
    You are told in no uncertain terms to turn around and return to where you came from. <br>
    They will not let you pass no matter what you try.<br><br>
