    <br><br><br> Down the path to the left you don't notice anything amiss. <br>
    That is until you stop paying attention to where you're walking. Something trips you and you go tumbling down a hill<br>
    and back into the clearing you started in.<br>
    After a moment of being unconcious, you wake up.
